You'll see that there are quite a few steps, but once you've gone through the process you'll see that its quite straightforward.

## Step 1: Get a task

First you need to claim one of the issues.

Look at the issues in this repo and find an issue that hasn't been assigned to anyone yet.

If it has not been assigned to anyone else, request to handle that task e.g.

_"Could I take this please?"_ / _"I would like to handle this"_

Once a task is assigned to you, you can proceed with the rest of the steps.

## Step 2: Making changes and opening the PR

Here is a guide you can follow: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/hacktoberfest-how-to-submit-your-first-pull-request-on-github

1. Request an issue to handle on GitHub, ensuring that no one else has that task.
2. Fork this repo once the issue has been assigned to you
3. Clone the fork to your computer
4. Make the changes as needed
5. Push the code:

```
git add .
git commit -m 'Your message'
git push
```

5. Go to your forked repo on GitHub and click "Pull request"
6. Write a message that contains your changes then click the button to create the PR.
7. A reviewer will then review your code and marge it if its acceptable. If there are changes still to be made, then you can simply make the changes in the codebase and then follow from step 4. above.
